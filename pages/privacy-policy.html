        <h3>
          General information on the legal basis for data processing on this
          website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we will process your
          personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9
          Para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special data categories are processed in
          accordance with Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent
          to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing
          is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If
          you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
          information on your device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data
          processing will also be carried out on the basis of &sect; 25 Para. 1
          TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary
          to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we
          process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
          Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a
          legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data
          processing can also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate
          interest in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information
          about the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in
          the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
        <p>
          As part of our business activities, we work with various external
          bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transmit personal data
          to these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external
          bodies if this is necessary to fulfill a contract, if we are legally
          obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have
          a legitimate interest in accordance with Article 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR
          in the transfer or if another legal basis allows the data transfer.
          When using order processors, we only pass on our customers' personal
          data on the basis of a valid order processing contract. In the case of
          joint processing, a joint processing contract is concluded.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
          consent. You can revoke any consent you have already given at any
          time. The lawfulness of the data processing carried out until the
          revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have the right

          exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial

          will only be done if it is technically feasible.

        <h3>Information, correction and deletion</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right to free information at any time about your stored personal data,
          its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if

          contact us at any time about this or if you have any further questions
          on the subject of personal data.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request that the processing of your personal
          data be restricted. You can contact us at any time about this. The
          right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of the personal data we hold about you,
            we will generally need time to verify this. For the duration of the
            review, you have the right to request that the processing of your
            personal data be restricted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is occurring unlawfully,
            you can request that data processing be restricted instead of
            deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to
            exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to
            request that the processing of your personal data be restricted
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Para. 1
            GDPR, a balance must be made between your interests and ours. As
            long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the
            right to request that the processing of your personal data be
            restricted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
          - apart from its storage - may only be used with your consent or to
          assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of
          another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
          interest of the European Union or a member state.
